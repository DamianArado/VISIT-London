# VISIT-London

This is a react application for my travel based startup for people visiting London, United Kingdom. The application is built on the React-Redux Architecture and using RESTful web services architecture. I have developed this Website(SPA) using ReactJs , Redux Architecture and REST API Client Server Communication.

## To check my project :-

1. Clone the github repo using the CLI or the GUI in Github
2. Go to the copied directory and open the terminal
3. Type : npm install
4. Initiate the 'npm start' for the react server
5. The browser open itself and the application is up and running
