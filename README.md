# VISIT-London

This is a react application for my travel 🤠 based startup for people visiting London, United Kingdom 🌄. The application is built on the React-Redux Architecture and using RESTful web services architecture 📌. I have developed this Website(SPA) using ReactJs , Redux Architecture and REST API Client Server Communication. 😄

## To check my project 😎 :-

2. Go to the copied directory and open the terminal
3. Type : 'npm install' to install the required dependencies
4. Initiate the 'npm start' for the react server
5. The browser open itself and the application is up and running
